					<p><strong>My name is Jamie Madigan I have worked in Catholic secondary schools for 19 years and I am currently Deputy Principal of Student Wellbeing at Caroline Chisholm Catholic College in Braybrook, Victoria. </strong></p>
					<p>Caroline Chisholm Catholic College currently has an enrolment of approximately 1,500 students, 120 teaching staff and 60 support staff. The College was amalgamated from 3 foundation schools in 1997. The College community currently has 58 nationalities represented in our student cohort and is situated in a low socio-economic area in Melbourne.</p>
					<p>The College is comprised of three sub-schools: Junior Boys School (Years 7-9 boys); Junior Girls School (Years 7-9 girls); Senior School (Years 10-12 girls and boys).</p>
					<p>I have previously held various leadership roles in the College. These include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>D eputy Principal Student Wellbeing (Current)</li>
						<li>H ead of Year 7-9 Junior Boys School</li>
						<li>H ead of Year 10-12 Senior School</li>
						<li>L earning and Teaching Coordinator</li>
						<li>P athways Coordinator</li>
						<li>V CE Coordinator</li>
						<li>H ealth and Physical Education Coordinator</li> 
					</ul>
					<p>My current role requires me to be deeply engaged with contemporary educational thought and practice in all areas, with a specific focus on ‘student wellbeing’. Over the years I have immersed myself in all facets of pastoral care, where the development of the whole person is of paramount importance. The building of selfesteem and a connectedness to College life through activities such as retreats, camps, academic competitions, sports and community service are a vital element of overall student wellbeing. Furthermore the development of the whole person within the Catholic school environment based on Gospel values also contributes significantly to student self-efficacy and wellbeing.</p>
					<p>I have recently completed my Masters of Educational Leadership at Australian Catholic University. In 2012 I also attended an International Educational Study Tour and visited over 25 high achieving schools throughout Finland England and Scotland.</p>
