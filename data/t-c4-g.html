						<h3>Holding the Deep Story</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Formation for mission has become a focus of energies across Australian Catholic Education agencies and systems. This has happened as the challenges around mission integrity in our contemporary setting have intensified. For leaders in this setting, formation must equip them beyond the skills for organizational expertise and management to ‘hold the deep story’ both personally and communally. What this means for each individual leader is played out in the dynamic of personal identity and community culture. Capturing the complexity of these interactive elements within a fertile formative environment calls for a model of formation that connects a Leader’s personal narrative to the great God meta-narrative in a way that is organic, intuitive context-relevant and transformative. This paper explores how such a model emerges from the best of the Catholic Christian tradition, and what it takes to nurture the soul texture of a Leader today. </p>

						<h3>Finding a Home for the Homeless: Defining the Mission and Identity of Australian Catholic Schools.</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>This paper will present research by BCEO and pilot studies with University of Leuven to suggestthat the mission and identity of catholic schools is paradoxical. While it continues to be strongly endorsed by staff, studentsand parents there is a more tenuous connection with the faith as it is expressed in mainstream church. Pollefeyt and Bouwens (2010)Post-critical belief scale expresses but does not explain the disconnect.Habermas’ concept of Lifeworlds, a three level structure comprised of cultural, social and personal worlds each involved in the process of reproduction and transformation will be used to explore the paradox and suggest the possibilities that might exist for catholic school leadership.Evidence from neuro-psychotherapy, brain science and our innate understanding of what it means to be human all suggest that personal capacity to experience “the mystery” that is our existence and the engage with life’s big questions remain intact, although sometimes muted by cultural and social structures. However, to find a home in which the personal faith journey can thrive and take root will sometimes require new ways to express catholic social and cultural identity in practice, symbol and story. The paper will suggest some of the possibilities that  might exist to address current challenges.
