						<h3>Beginning the School Principalship in Rural and Remote Catholic Schools in Western Australia</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The only opportunity for a future for kids in the remote community is an education… if it doesn’t happen for them at school … well, it limits their life outcome.</p>
							<p>The sense of vocation and determination expressed by this beginning principal of a remote Catholic school in north Western Australia highlights the importance and relevance of quality education and leadership. The desire to provide the best educational opportunities for young people is strong amongst school leaders. The complexities surrounding remote and rural schooling are great; however, it is further compounded by the newness to the role of school principalship. This presentation reports on the findings from a doctoral study examining the professional needs of beginning principals. The particular aspect that is drawn from the research is the case study on beginning principals in rural and remote schools in Catholic education, W.A. The research reflects on the beginning school principals needs in the area of their technical and managerial knowledge; cultural and personal relationships; and integrating their principal role with their self-identity.</p>

						<h3>Re-Imagining the Mission - Goulburn to Gonski!</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Aim: To engage participants in reflecting on the snapshot of 1962-2013 through an ecclesial, sociological, spiritual, educational and personal lens emanating from a response to Mission. It will engage participants in response to the following questions through a Case Study approach – Catholic Education Sandhurst.</p>
							<p>Is leading the mission in 2013 in the context of Gonski very different to leading the mission in the Goulburn Strike days of 1962?</p>
							<p>What do the contexts of 1962 and 2013 have in common?</p>
							<p>What is the call to mission today? </p>
							<p>What qualities and capacities are needed for leading for mission in 2013?</p>
							<p>This workshop presents reflections on the opportunities and challenges of leading for mission in 2013 - it's not about theory but about identity</p>
