							<p>Research in education, community development and leadership have shown that parent and family engagement, in partnership with schools, improves the educational outcomes and opportunities of students from childhood to adolescence and beyond, irrespective of socioeconomic circumstances. </p>
							<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the journey of a group of parent leaders within the Sandhurst Diocese who were integral in the development and implementation of a parent leadership and family engagement strategy.  The strategy aims to enable schools, parents, carers, families and communities to shape culture and unearth the capacity within school communities to build every child’s achievement, well being, life chances and spirit of service, true to the Catholic Mission, in an ever changing world. </p>
