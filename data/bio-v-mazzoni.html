Since 2011 is Assistant Professor at the Department of Philosophy, Education and Psychology - University of Verona – where she is affiliated to CRED (Research Centre in Education and Didactics). </strong></p>
					<p>In 2010 she was Visiting Scholar at Australian Catholic University, where she conducted a research with toddler in an early-learning centre. Her research work has developed from a careful reflection upon research methods, which are considered suitable for educative settings and are able to actively involve children in research processes. In particular, she has advanced her research competences, using qualitative methods and research tools. </p>
					<p>Her privileged research contexts are early childhood services and primary schools. Her research work aims to understand children’s experience when they encounter the world. In such an effort, her interest nowadays concerns the understanding of moral aspects in children’s development. In particular, she is currently engaged in a research project with children on virtues. She is member of the Scientific Committee of the peer reviewed Journal “Encyclopaideia”, and member of the international associations EECERA and EARLI.</p>
