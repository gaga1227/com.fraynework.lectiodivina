					<p><strong>After completing a Bachelor of Psychology degree at Malang (indonesia) University, I was employed by World Vision in East Timor, to work with young people in the area of well-being and communication in Baucau. After one year, I had the opportunity to start working at ICFP Baucau - the Catholic Teachers College. I began lecturing in Educational Psychology and Teaching and Learning Theory.</strong></p>
					<p>As a member of ICFP teaching staff, I was able to commence studies for a Masters degree in Education through ACU. I completed the degree and graduated in 2011.</p>
					<p>During my time at ICFP I have been fortunate to be able to learn not only about teacher education, but also, had the opportunity to develop my own leadership capacity, first as Coordinator of the Bachelor of Teaching program, and for the last two years as Deputy Director, being mentored by one of the international staff members at the Institute.</p>
					<p>At the end of 2011, one other staff member and I visited Australia for the first time, attending a Marist Brothers' Formation course. In addition to the conference, we were able to visit Marist schools, as well as ACU in Sydney and Melbourne. This experience has given me a wider perspective on the world, and has certainly influenced my personal philosophy and my vision for education in Timor Leste.</p>
