						<h3>Leadership for Inclusion and Policy-making: Initiatives of the Catholic Education Sector in Mauritius for the Preferential Option for the Poor</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Mauritius is an island of 1,2M inhabitants with a minority population of Creoles who are in majority Catholic in faith. The academic achievement of the Creoles is in general lower when compared to the rest of the population, thus resulting in a greater economic and social divide. The Diocese of Port-Louis has for the past decade pioneered several projects in education and has implemented internal policy decisions in line with the preferential option for the poor. Some of these initiatives have led	to national policy decisions in areas such as the inclusion of the mother-tongue and the inclusion of young persons which the education system has failed. Other pioneer projects have started, amongst others an adult education program for those who wish to resume their secondary education.</p>
							<p>Three interrelated areas weave themselves through the three case studies: ethnicity, language and poverty which all have a direct impact on school achievement.  This paper gives an overview of the initiatives of the Catholic education sector for greater social justice, as well as the remaining challenges in the socio-economic and political context of Mauritius.</p>
							<p>Key words: social justice, inclusion, preferential option for the poor, ethnicity, language hierarchy, policy-making&hellip;</p>

						<h3>Teaching Aboriginal Perspectives in the NSW Curriculum</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>St Charles' Primary School at Waverley has sustained an Aboriginal Perspectives Program for more than a decade. They have achieved this by using a three tiered approach that is consolidated into the second term of each year. Specifically:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>students K-6 engage in an integrated curriculum that highlights the Aboriginal Perspective</li>
								<li>staff yarn with people who have lived and worked in Aboriginal communities. This promotes understanding and exposure to Aboriginal people and their issues</li>
								<li>parents are exposed to Aboriginal Perspectives though newsletter articles that highlight contemporary and historical matters</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Additionally a school exchange program between St Charles and St Mary's at Bowraville is a feature of the Program. This has also been sustained from 2002 to the present.</p>
