			<h1>James 5:7-10 [3,3]</h1>
			<p>4For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.</p>
			<p>5May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus,6so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p>7Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.8For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,9and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore I will confess you among the Gentiles, and sing praises to your name".</p>
