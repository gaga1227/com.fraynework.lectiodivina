						<h3>The Role of Partnership in Support of Capacity Building of Teacher Education in East Timor</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Following the referendum in 1999 to create an independent East Timor, a College was established at Baucau on the North coast of the country to prepare qualified teachers for the schools. </p>
							<p>The initiative to establish the College came from the Bishop of Baucau who invited the Marist Brothers from the Province of Melbourne to establish, and in the first instance, to staff the College. As professional development and teacher education courses developed, the College invited Australian Catholic University to provide quality assurances processed and later to credit the courses and embrace them under the ACU umbrella. </p>
							<p>This paper reports and critiques the role of capacity building in East Timor through teacher education and evaluates the partnership of the Bishop, the Brothers and the University in the development of the College.. </p>

						<h3>Who’s Leading Who? Parish - School Partnerships. Is It Really a Partnership?</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Our aim is to have strong healthy school – parish partnerships where all stakeholders are working together in the formation of the child to become a disciple of Jesus. No one would disagree with this.  But is this a reality, or is it only occurring in theory? Is it really a partnership? Who’s taking the lead? Are the school and the parish separate entities? What is the school doing for the parish? What is the parish doing for the school? And where is the family in all of this? </p>
							<p>This workshop will look at whether partnership really exists?  It will look at the role of both the school, particularly systemic primary schools, and the parish in the partnership, and whether it is a partnership at all. It will examine what problems exist, where good partnerships are occurring, and what could occur in the future? </p>

						<h3>Strengthening Family and Community Engagement in Student Learning and Well-being: Why Families and Communities Matter. </h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>In this presentation, Danielle will lead a discussion around family and community engagement in learning, why it matters and what school and system leaders can do to enhance it. This session will examine the latest research, policy and practice and provide an opportunity for participants to learn about a suite of new tools that school and system leaders can use to move beyond ‘random acts’ of parent and community involvement to a more a planned, evidence­based and strategic approach. The focus will be on aligning parent and community engagement efforts with the educational goals/ purpose of the school. </p>
