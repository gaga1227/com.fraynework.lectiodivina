						<h3>High Performing Teachers Exhibiting Leadership and Making a Difference in a Learning Community.</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Whilst the Principal of a school can provide opportunities for teachers to grow professionally, it must be stated that teachers have already acquired many qualities that highlight effective teaching practice within the school community. The role of the Principal is only justified if they support teaching staff in the overall philosophy and vision of the school that they helped shape together.</p>
							<p>After an explanation of the role of Principal, two high performing teachers who have just completed Phase Two in the Victorian Institute Of Teachings Quality Teaching Program, will discuss how they have helped to create a culture in our school community that maximises learning and values the input of all stakeholders ( being students, colleagues and parents) within the school environment.</p>
							<p>Our presenters will further clarify that teaching doesn't end in the classroom and that collegial support is required when developing high quality teaching practice when working to the Professional Standards for Teachers.</p>

						<h3>Our Story: A Journey of Leading for Learning</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore how the experiences within a school improvement project influenced the understanding and practice of leading for learning of members of a primary school leadership team, to study the development and influence of school-based initiatives, and to examine the role of the principal in these experiences. This research flowed out of an experience where the school was involved in an improvement project called “Leaders Transforming Learning and Learners”, in collaboration with Australian Catholic University, which then led to the development of a structured school improvement project called the “Planning for Authentic Learning Model”. The research considers the topics from the perspectives of the project leaders, the leadership team, the teachers, and the principal, and their stories of leading for learning. The research question asks: How did the experiences within a school improvement project influence the understanding and practice of leading for learning of members of a primary school leadership team?</p>
							<p>The study aims to examine the influences on the understandings and practices of leadership for learning within the context of a Catholic primary school. Insights and perceptions have the potential to contribute to practitioners’ knowledge of leadership team development in primary schools.</p>
