				<h1>Romans 13:11-14</h1>
				<p>11Besides this, you know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers;12the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of light;13let us live honourably as in the day, not in revelling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy.14Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</p>
