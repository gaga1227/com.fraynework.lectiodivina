						<h3>Quality Teacher Education in Timor Leste - a Growing Reality</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The urgent need for qualified and capable teachers has been an ongoing concern for government, church and community during the 13 years since Timor Leste gained its independence from Indonesia. Initially providing professional development for teachers and directors of schools throughout the districts,  ICFP officially opened its doors to commence training of primary school teachers in September, 2003.  These students undertake three years’ training to  gain a Bachelor of Teaching (Primary) first accredited by ACUy but today awarded by ICFP  in its own right as an accredited tertiary education institute in Timor Leste. At the present time, ACU provides internal quality assurance for the Bachelor of Teaching program to ensure quality standards equal to similar degrees in Australia. </p>
							<p>This presentation traces the history of ICFP until the present, and concludes with a plan for the future development of the Institute. The presentation focuses on how the vision  of educational quality has resulted in well qualified, creative and critical thinking graduates who will aid the growth of formal education for young people throughout Timor Leste. </p>

						<h3>It’s About Good Teaching</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Is it possible to meet the needs of each student? Can every student learn? Does the teacher really make the difference?  In today’s world, the work of teachers is complex and challenging. However, when we put the best of what we know, from the theory and practice, is put into practice, it CAN and DOES make a difference the lives of students. Greg Whitby will explore what good teaching is and how we can improve it in order to improve the learning outcomes of each and every student. He will challenge the notion that good teaching is just a list of personal traits or characteristics, and demonstrate how leadership plays a critical role in shaping the thinking and practice of teachers to drive improvement. </p>
