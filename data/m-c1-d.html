						<h3>Implementing the Australian Curriculum Within the Conext of the Catholic Worldview</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The current development of national curriculum in Australia provides significant opportunities and challenges for the country’s 1,700 Catholic schools.  This paper considers the growing interest in the nature of Catholic curriculum from an Australian perspective, at a time of national debate about curriculum.  It also offers a case study of the development and implementation of the Diocese of Broken Bay Catholic Worldview statement as an example of a contextualized Catholic curriculum theology. The Catholic Worldview statement includes ten propositions which reflect the hierarchy of truths central in Catholic teaching. From these a set of associated values have been identified which can articulate the Catholic faith in a contemporary cultural context, and serve as the basis for the implementation of the Australian curriculum. The focus of the project is not on what it means to be Catholic in a generalized sense, but on an approach to Catholic curriculum in the context of a particular diocese, in a particular culture, and at a particular time. However, it may serve as a model and inspiration for other contexts.</p>

						<h3>Vocare: Called to What?</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>We form adults who have the best chance of having a happy adult life – a whole person. But most students graduate and drop out of life-long learning as spiritual beings. If Catholic schools are to be effective we must develop a radical prayer and spiritual life that enables students to know who they are, what they are called to be, and a deep and intimate relationship with their Creator. Students see themselves as spiritual, but do not live their adult lives in a way that focuses on deepening that spirituality. It is not lifelong spirituality. Once out of the school environment, most do not take responsibility for the continuing development of their spirituality.</p>
							<p>We must examine our purpose, and then develop a curriculum based on the teachings of Jesus and the traditions of the Church. We must develop practices, environment and rhythm to the day that model and facilitate prayer and meditative growth, and to do that we need to reclaim the spiritual understanding of vocare (to call or summon).</p>

						<h3>From Checkpoints to Classrooms: Contemporary Challenges to the Identity and Mission of Catholic Education in the Palestinian Context</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The ongoing struggle between the Israelis and the Palestinians has dramatically affected Catholic education in the region. School administrators continue to work tirelessly in order to transmit a strong Catholic identity to the next generation of students, yet many obstacles hinder the efforts. Within the last twenty years, many unique challenges have in fact put Catholic education in a perilous position. Issues such as increased operational costs, decreased Catholic student populations, secularization due to foreign influences, and ideological strife have made it nearly impossible for the Roman Catholic Church to use their schools as tools for evangelization. This paper first explores the history of Catholic education in the region; it then outlines the unenviable position in which Catholic administrators are now situated. Because the Catholics are a clear minority within the Jewish population of Israel and the Islamic population of the West Bank, they have few allies; Catholic education therefore suffers due to lack of support. Today, given a host of additional problems, administrators generally look to foreign organizations for financial, political, structural, and spiritual support. Much to their great dismay, the international responses to their appeals have been minimal.</p>
							<p>Relying on historical research as well as contemporary interview data with both Palestinians and Israelis, this paper demonstrates that—although Catholic schools have been ubiquitous within the region since the 13th century—this generation will see their extinction unless something is done. If there is a future for Catholic education in the Holy Land, then a radical transformation is needed—this, unfortunately, demands that the international Catholic community see the urgency of the current situation and become intimately involved.</p>
