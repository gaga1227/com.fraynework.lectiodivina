					<p><strong>I have taught in 4 Catholic schools in the archdiocese of Melbourne for the past 33 years. I have been Deputy Principal at Vaucluse College in Richmond (1992 – 1994) and currently Deputy Principal at St Monica’s College, Epping (1995 – present). My qualifications are as follows: Bachelor of Arts (Newcastle), Bachelor of Theology (Yarra Theological Union, Box Hill), Graduate Diploma of Education (Mercy Teachers College), Master of Education (La Trobe University), Graduate Certificate of Education – LOTE (La Trobe University), Doctor of Education (ACU, Melbourne). </strong></p>
					<p>In 2013 I am the Deputy Principal (ICT & Innovation) a new role at the College. Innovation is not restricted to the development of ICT in the College but applies to all elements of College life. My approach to innovation is that it is about executing a new idea to create value and this is not the same as having a new idea which is invention. I am seeking to apply this approach across the whole of school life. </p>
					<p>One of the innovation projects starting this year is a joint project with St Peter’s Parish, Epping. At the end of 2012 I was approached by Fr Maurie Cooney, PP at St Peter’s Epping about how St Peter’s and St Monica’s College could work more closely to engage the youth of the Epping area, an area that is rapidly expanding in what is known as the Epping North and Plenty corridors. </p>
					<p>Maurie, myself and his Pastoral Coordinator met at the end of 2012 and we continue our work together in February 2013 to further explore and develop this practical relationship. Since the completion of my Educational Doctorate in 2009 Fr Maurie and I have had ongoing discussions about my work and proposals in the thesis relating to the need for secondary school and local church to work more closely in terms of faith education and ongoing involvement in the church post-school. </p>
					<p>The title of my thesis is, <a href="http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp277.02032011/index.html" class="c-blu" target="_blank">"Catholic Schools Seeking Authenticity in a Secular and Pluralistic Society"</a>.It documents research in three Catholic schools in Melbourne and poses the question of the authenticity of Catholic schools in the face of declining church involvement. The research pointed to the need for secondary school and local church to connect in more practical ways rather than rely simply on Religious Education lessons. </p>
					<p>RE needs to be complemented with real parish based connections to enliven faith development and to address the massive drop off of young people from church involvement post school. </p>
					<p>I have held the following positions of leadership in my career as a Catholic Educator: Faculty Coordinator (Religious Education, Humanities, Information Technology), Year Level Coordinator (Years 8 & 11), Director of Studies, Deputy Principal. It was during my Bachelor of Theology that I developed a passion </p>
