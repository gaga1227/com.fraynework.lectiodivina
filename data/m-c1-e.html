						<h3>Cultivating a Positive School Culture in a Catholic High School Setting: The Principal's Role</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>There is a growing body of research about the important role of the school principal in cultivating a positive school culture. School culture influences all happenings in a school.  This therefore impacts upon an individual behaviour, expectations and interactions with others. It follows that cultivating and sustaining a positive school culture should be one of the highest priorities for all school principals. However, there is limited research; to gain a detailed insight into strategies principals can implement to improve the culture of the school.</p>
							<p>The results from the research highlight that the principal has a pivotal and crucial role in the cultivation of a positive school culture. The strategies used by the principal in this research were consistent with the literature on the role of school principals and school culture.  It was found that articulating a shared vision, developing a sense of belonging amongst members of the community, developing collaboration between staff, good communication skills, clearly visible in supporting students’ endeavours and treating people fairly were some of the strategies that cultivate a positive school culture.</p>
							<p>The findings of this research can serve as a framework for Catholic school principals to cultivate a positive culture within their own schools.</p>
