						<h3>Who We Are, Where We Are Going and How We Are Going to Get There?</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Catholic College Bendigo has grown in enrolments from ~1600 to 1920 in 5 years. It has recently moved from three Governors (2 Religious Orders and the Bishop) to becoming a sole governed Mercy College. To ensure all involved in our community are aware and true to the Mission and Identity of the College the last four years have seen a process involving the rewriting of the Mission statement, setting new strategic intentions and associated goals. It has also included restructuring the College to create 15 Decision Making Teams and empowering the staff in these teams. </p>
							<p>Immersed in the theme of Leading for Mission and Identity this workshop will look at:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>consultations with staff, parents and students to articulate a shared identity,</li>
								<li>the changing charism and dynamics of the college, </li>
								<li>the processes of  re-authoring the core documents, </li>
								<li>conducting a two day completely internally run conference for 250 staff focusing on the core beliefs of the new Mission Statement </li>
								<li>Processes and staff formation required to restructure and create 15 Decision Making Teams </li>
								<li>The three year plan for 2013 -2105 and processes to oversee we remain true to our Mission and Identity</li>
							</ul>
							<p>It is a story of dynamic change within a changing landscape of enrolments, governance and charism. It is a lived experience of leading for Mission and Identity. </p>
