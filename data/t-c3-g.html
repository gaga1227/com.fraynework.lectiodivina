						<h3>Teacher Wellbeing – Time for Action!</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>We  care  for  the  wellbeing  of  our  students  but  how  much  do we care  for the  wellbeing  of  our  teachers? As  the  major resource  in  any  educational  institution do  we  really  look  after  them  and  give  them  strategies  to  maintain  their  vibrancy and  creativity? Should  we  accept  that  50  hours  of intensive  work  each  week  has no  effect  on  the  teacher’s  health  and general  wellbeing? Is  it  solely  the responsibility  of  each  teacher  to  manage  their  own wellbeing  or  do the educational institution, unions  and  Government  have  a  role  to  play? In  my  29  years  of  teaching,  I  have  received  very  little  in  the way of  support  and  strategies  to help  me  look  after  myself.  Sorry,  enough  is  enough  and  now  as  a  Senior  Leader,  I  am doing something  about  it. This  is  the  one  presentation  this  year  that  you  do  not want  to miss:  music,  humour and practical  ideas  to  take  away.  A  look  at the  data  on  teachers’  health  should  scare  most people  into  action. What  are Leadership  teams  within  our  educational  institutions  doing  to look after  their  teachers  and  what  strategies  are  available? Come  and  share your  ideas  as  it is time  for  action  on  teacher  wellbeing. </p>
