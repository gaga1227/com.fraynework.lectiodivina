						<h3>Challenges and Change for Future Leadership</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>This study is on the introduction of lay leadership in the five Australian Jesuit schools and influence on the Jesuit tradition of Catholic education. This is significant because vocations are not being maintained at a rate that will enable the Jesuits to provide for the academic, parish, pastoral and social justice activities in which they are involved throughout the Australian province. The vocation shortage is long-term, not just temporary. Social pressures causing this are strong and present a new social context for the Church to seek new strategies for the Christian mission in this setting. The social, economic, political and ecclesiastical features of modern Australian society also impact on these schools today. The laity and school community are strong in faith and ready to serve the Church. Spirituality among Catholics is strong and their involvement and dedication evidenced in schools of other religious Orders. Qualified and experienced laity with professional development and opportunities to participate in roles of governance and build partnerships with the clergy are exist in our schools. </p>
							<p>It is hoped the study will influence the relationship of the laity and Jesuits and contribute to the development of an influential and effective leadership within these schools.</p>

						<h3>Mission and Identity</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Our research (Neidhart & Lamb, 2010; 2011; 2012) aims to understand how principals in Catholic primary and secondary schools conceptualise and enact faith leadership. To date this research has involved 57 principals from three rural dioceses in Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales. These principals completed an online survey followed by individual and focus group interviews. This research finds that the principals appreciate the challenge of faith leadership in our secular society. They conceptualise faith leadership in terms of evangelisation to support the church’s mission. The principals rely on a deep personal faith commitment, combined with a preparedness to engage others in faith conversations. At the same time, they are mindful of the limits of their theological knowledge and express a concern about the knowledge, skills and attitudes of the next generation of faith leaders. They recommend a diocesan approach to working “bottom up” to build faith leadership capabilities. This paper suggests a way forward to support this recommendation.</p>
