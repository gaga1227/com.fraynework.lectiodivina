						<h3>Focus, Capacity and Leadership: Reflections on System Initiatives in Leading Learning.</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Sydney Catholic Education Office has worked to enhance learning outcomes for its students through system wide initiatives with a focus on the role of leadership.  The Reading and Mathematics Program is one such initiative.</p>
							<p>The key strategy has been to create a school position, know as a Teacher Educator (TE)  (Primary) or a Leader of Pedagogy (LoP) (Secondary) to support the leadership team of the school with a focus on building teacher capacity. </p>
							<p>It is too early to have reliable data on student outcomes, however there is a deal of evidence of changed teacher practice. Teachersâ€™ use of data has improved. Classrooms are more open, and  and there is greater sharing of knowledge. Evaluations indicate that teachers in participating schools have participated more actively in innovative approaches to teaching and learning. </p>
