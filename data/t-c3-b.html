						<h3>Educating Hearts: Identifying a “Good” School</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>This paper will present a method for identifying a "good" school. In so doing, it aims to inspire Catholic leadership to think unter-culturally. Drawing upon research from their   recently published book, Educating Hearts: Identifying a Good School (St Paul's Press, 2013), the two authors will present seven characteristics of a "good" education paradigm. The paper will move on to argue that education is different to "schooling" for league table respectability. In not discounting academic excellence, the paper highlights that traditionally education was about becoming a person, secure in one's own identity and with a sense of belonging to one's faith, family and community. From this situation an understanding of responsibility may be nurtured which in turn fosters human flourishing and a personal sense of wellbeing. It is in serving others rather than ourselves that we become fully human.</p>
							<p>The paper will argue that Catholic mission and identity grow out from the realisation that we are called to serve our neighbour. In that service we experience transcendence, and encounter God who dwells preferentially with those on the margins. The mission of a Catholic school and university is to liberate the human person from their contemporary characterisation as an economic unit. Central to this liberation is an understanding of the Christian virtues.</p>
							<p>The paradox explored in the paper, includes the reality that we are very good at producing clever accountants, bankers, medics, lawyers, politicians and so forth, but we should question our competency at producing “good" politicians, lawyers, teachers, journalists and architects. The possibilities outlined in the paper include the development of an authentic Gospel-based Catholic identity, one that does not define itself in opposition to the diversity of modernity, but rather has the ability to authentically ‘read the signs of the time’ and to engage in dialogue with the age for the common good. The vision of a "good" school presented in this paper, aims to educate the heart through experiential learning. It is in educating the heart of our young people that a school witnesses to a distinctly Catholic sacramental vision, growing out of ancient Catholic traditions, more recently contextualized in the documents of Vatican II.</p>
