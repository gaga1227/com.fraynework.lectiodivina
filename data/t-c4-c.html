						<h3>System Capacity Building: Transcending Existing Structures and Mindsets</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>There is a notable shift in focus within the educational reform agenda, with greater attention now being given to whole of system capacity building. This focus requires all within the system, whether in the central bureaucracy, the school or the classroom to be connected and committed to system achievement - ensuring deep and meaningful learning for all students. While this is an important shift in focus, it will be suggested that system capacity building conceived within the existing interventionist and regulatory understanding of educational reform is limited, and not sufficient to re-orientate education systems towards achieving  its moral purpose. </p>
							<p>The presenter will invite an exploration of education systems as complex adaptive systems. This will include an understanding of capacity building as an emergent process. A process that opens up possibilities for other ways of thinking, working and being within education systems that transcend the existing structures and mindsets of educational reform. </p>
							<p>The presentation will draw on current doctoral research.</p>

						<h3>Nurturing Charism in Catholic Schools</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Charism offers a special way for Catholic schools to demonstrate their identity.  Implementing the charism is an expression of authenticity of a Catholic school.  The problem is that there may well be an inconsistency between school rhetoric and the lived experience of charism by students, teachers and parents. </p>
							<p>This presentation of doctoral research concerns the congruency between the articulation of the Dominican charism and how students, teachers and parents experience it at San Sisto College. </p>

						<h3>Experiences of Tongan Immigrant Students in Australian Catholic Schools and Influences on Their Engagement in Learning.</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The study explored and recorded the stories of the experiences of four Year 9 Tongan immigrant students in two Australian secondary schools, and identified the issues influencing their engagement in learning.  The study utilised a Biographic Narrative Interpretive Methodology (BNIM) to record, interpret and analyse the data of the participating students.  The study also explored the perspective of the Tongan immigrant parents,  administrators and teachers of the Catholic schools context, using 'talatalaifale', a Tongan way of conversation,  and focus group interviews. </p>
							<p>Significantly, the findings indicated that Tongan language and culture have significant impact on the efforts of the Tongan immigrant students to engage in their learning in an Australian school context.  The importance of culturally appropriate relationships between schools, families and Tongan communities was identified.  Additionally, the data revealed the importance of the relatedness of the culture in the teaching strategies, as well as issues related to leadership of the Tongan community and their Catholic school age children. </p>
							<p>The findings and recommendations of the study could also have relevance  to other immigrant students of South Pacific and non European descent and Indigenous Australians. </p>
