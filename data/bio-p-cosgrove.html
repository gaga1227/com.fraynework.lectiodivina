					<p><strong>General Peter John Cosgrove AC, MC, CNZM is a retired Australian Army officer. He was the Chief of the Defence Force for 3 years, when he retired from full-time service. </strong></p> 
					<p>He was born in Sydney and educated at Waverley College. Having decided on a military career, Peter entered Duntroon in 1965 as Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War was escalating. Graduating as a Lieutenant in 1968, he was posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR) in December 1968 and subsequently served in Malaysia.</p>					
					<p>Peter's next posting was to the 9RAR. He commanded an infantry platoon in Vietnam and was awarded the Military Cross. In 1970 he returned to Australia and was promoted to Captain and posted to the Methods of Instruction Team. After two years in this post, Peter became Aide-de-Camp to the Governor General in 1972. The following year he was posted as Captain to 5RAR as a company second in command; he served there for three years as the Adjutant and later as a company commander.  In 1976 he was promoted to Major and became an instructor at the Infantry Centre.</p> 
					<p>In 1978 Peter went to the United States to attend the Marine Corps Command and Staff College at Quantico. Having returned to Australia in 1979, he began four years of staff appointments in Sydney, being promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1982. He took command of 1RAR in 1983 and became the Australian Army Exchange Instructor at the Army Staff College in England in late 1984. In 1987 he became Military Assistant to the Chief of the General Staff. By 1990 he had been promoted to Colonel and become the Army's Director of Infantry and Commandant of the Infantry Centre, and two years later he was promoted to Brigadier and appointed commander of the 6th Brigade in Brisbane. A posting to India followed in 1994 after which Peter took command of the Australian Defence Force Warfare Centre in 1995. In 1997 he became Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. </p>  
					<p>In 1998 Peter was promoted to Major General and assumed command of the Deployable Joint Force Headquarters in Brisbane. This appointment would lead to the role which catapulted him to public prominence - commander of INTERFET (International Forces East Timor), where he was responsible for overseeing East Timor's transition to independence. He returned to Australia in 2000 having won plaudits for his performance in East Timor where he combined the roles of soldier and diplomat to ensure that a difficult and dangerous situation was managed with a minimum of bloodshed. He was appointed a Companion of the Military Division of the Order of Australia for his service in East Timor. The following year his efforts were recognised with his being named Australian of the Year.</p> 
					<p>Further recognition followed with Peter's promotion to Lieutenant General and appointment as Chief of Army in 2000, which was followed in 2002 by promotion to General and his appointment to Chief of the Defence Force. On 20 March 2006, Peter was selected to lead the Queensland Government taskforce of rebuilding communities damaged by Cyclone Larry, a Category 5 tropical cyclone that devastated the Innisfail region of northern Queensland.</p> 
					<p>Apart from his early education at Waverley College, a Christian Brothersâ€™ school in Sydney, he has spent most of his life as a parishioner of that great "Catholic military parish" which exists all around Australia and wherever soldiers serve overseas. He has frequently spoken and written about spirituality and faith, especially that embraced by men and women in uniform who serve in harm's way.</p> 
					<p>He married his wife Lynne in 1976 and the couple have three sons. Outside his life in the military, Peter has been a life-long sports enthusiast and was at one stage patron of the Australian Army and Combined Services Rugby Union and the Australian Services Cricket Association. He has received numerous principal among which is the QANTAS board.</p>
