					<p>I am a Christian Brother and have recently graduated from ACU with a PhD having researched the probable needs for people to become leaders with canonical responsibility for the emerging PJPs in health and education. My supervisor, Prof Mike Gaffney, made the 5th Conference aware of the research in his key note address in 2010.</p> 
					<p>I have been a teacher, principal for 17 years (including a Foundation Principal), administrator, consultant and researcher.</p>   
					<p>I was on the Christian Brothers' Planning Committee (2002 - 2007) for the creation of Edmund Rice Education Australia - a PJP.</p>
					
					<p>2008 - 2009 I was on the Board of EREA I am currently assisting with the creation of a significant data base for the Christian Brothers needs in Professional Standards;<br>
					I am the canonical representative in CHCS (a PJP) for the Parish of Chatswood;<br>
					Company Secretary for Charingfield Age Care Limited;<br>
					I am a Sessional Lecturer at ACU in Governance and Education Policy.<br></p>

					<p>The thesis addressed formation for Canonical Governance. Part of the reflection of Sr Julianna Casey, IHM, PhD, STD, the international examiner of the dissertation are below:</p> 
					<p>"To my knowledge, this is the first systematic study of formation developments in both the US and Australia. Much of the information and publishing that has been done in the area of the new 'public juridic personsâ€™ has been anecdotal or limited in scope. Thornber has given the larger picture.</p> 
					<p>The thesis also provides an important overview of the questions that have arisen in the area of Canonical Governance, especially as these concern perceived differences between the desirability of certain traits and their presence among the Canonical Governors.</p> 
					<p>Thornber has raised a question that others must begin to answer."</p> 
					<p>The work defined formation for governance, tested whether certain traits were seen as relevant for the role, and sought opinion on whether the relevant traits were perceived to exist in practice.</p> 
					<p>In April 2013, I have been invited to be a presenter in the workshop sessions with Fr Gerry Arbuckle at a Leadership and Governance Conference for Catholic Health Australia.</p>
