						<h3>Responses to Issues of Access to Catholic Schools Within the Australian Catholic Education Tradition</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>In previous papers the author has explored some of the challenges relating to access to Catholic schools in contemporary Australia by the poor. A most recent paper identified some strategies that Catholic education system leaders have initiated in meeting these challenges. An underlying assumption of the author is the paradox that, at the time when Catholic schools appear to be so highly successful and widely attractive in Australia, the issue of access for poorer children continues to be a challenge.</p>
							<p>Continuing her exploration of this challenge, in this paper, the author turns to history to gain insights into the responses of earlier leaders in making Catholic schools "schools for all". The paper focuses on select examples from within the Australian Catholic education tradition and, in particular, Catholic educational leaders' initiatives to ensure access by those who were in greatest need. Examples will draw on significant events, people or institutions, especially religious congregations.</p>
							<p>By turning to history, the author seeks to throw light on contemporary challenges through the ambiguities and paradoxes of the past and to add depth to contemporary understandings of the tradition of Catholic education for all in Australia.</p>

						<h3>Diversity and Mission in a Catholic Secondary School</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>To strive for excellence in mission whilst enhancing religious identity in a culture that is suspicious of transcendence and any notion of a ‘grand narrative’ is the contemporary challenge for Catholic schools. This presentation is one response to the creative tensions of the current milieu.</p>
							<p>A priority for schools is to engage with the diversity of the whole school population. This diversity is empirically verified by data gathered under critically recognised surveys and methods of internal data collection. Drawing on the work of Bernard Lonergan, SJ, insight into the data leads to a proposal for creative engagement with the diversity by promoting our self-appropriation of theunrestricted desire to know without sacrificing the riches of diversity.</p>
							<p>This presentation suggests the transformation of staff is a priority. A heuristic is offered to define and connect a series of judgments of meaning and value that opens or identifies an experience of transcendence through one’s response to the unrestricted desire to know written on our souls.</p>
							<p>Finally, it will also show how this experience of transcendence suggests affirmation of mission as ‘gift’ and the Christian imperative to share this gift: thus we come to the heart of mission/identity required of our Catholic schools.</p>
