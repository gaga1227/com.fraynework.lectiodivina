					<p><strong>I am principal of Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School at Kenmore in Brisbane. OLR has 625 students, from 420 families and has 70 staff. It is part of the Kenmore Parish. I am responsible for the spiritual and educational leadership of the students and staff of our community. I have been at OLR since the start of 2009, following seven and half years at St Sebastian's Yeronga in Brisbane, where I commenced my first principal appointment in July 2001.I have worked across 6 schools within Brisbane Catholic Education for the past 25 years.</strong></p>
					<p>In 2006 I undertook the Teaching Australia -Leading Australia's Schools Leadership program in Melbourne - a week long residential course for leading principals, nominated by their education authority, (Brisbane Catholic Education).</p>
					<p>In 2010 I presented a paper at the ACU International Leadership Conference - "Monitoring Teacher work for School Improvement".</p>
					<p>In the same year I was nominated for the Tom Fitzsimon Award - a peer nominated award within the Brisbane Catholic Primary Principals Association.</p>
					<p>In 2012 I undertook some personal, professional renewal leave and travelled to Italy to re-connect with my Franciscan heritage (as I was taught by the Franciscans at Padua College, Kedron, Brisbane)- visiting Venice, Florence, Assisi and Rome - a fantastic time of spiritual renewal. During this time I had the opportunity to read some books of Ronald Rolheiser and Bill Hybels. This prompted me to reflect on how I put my faith and leadership into daily practice, within the paradoxical environment in which we sometimes work. It is full of possibilities!</p>
