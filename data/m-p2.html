						<h3 class="c-blk">Leading Lights: Opportunities in the Current Cultural Context for a Proactive Missional Stance</h3>	
						<p>This presentation will provide a backdrop of the wider landscape, providing a broader context for issues arising at this conference. A context analysis of the wider community and churches, will be given using Australian census and survey data, alongside 20 years of National Church Life Survey trends. What are the presenting values of Australians?  What is the current perceived place of religion and spirituality? What place do churches hold in the contemporary landscape? With a perspective from outside the Catholic education system, Ruth will propose that leaders in Catholic education are well placed not simply to react to cultural forces. They have extraordinary resources to draw upon to take a proactive stance to shape a wider understanding of mission for the common good. Beyond their own schools, Catholic leaders will be encouraged to offer leadership to other faith-based schools, to churches (including non-Catholic faith traditions) and in the public square. Continuing to nurture a strong inclusive Catholic identity will be at the heart of effective missional leadership into the future and will provide a source of light to the wider community.</p>
