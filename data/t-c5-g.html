						<h3>What Must I Know &amp; Be If I'm to Lead a PJP?</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The Catholic Church is facing a major change in the governance of its vast ministries in health, education and welfare. These ministries have been the canonical responsibility of Religious Institutes and many of the institutes no longer have the members willing or able to undertake the responsibilities of governance.  Changes in membership of Church governing bodies are also in many places being accompanied by changes in the structure and function of the bodies themselves.  These bodies referred to as Public Juridic Persons (PJPs) are responsible for the stewardship of the mission; in essence their role is to ensure that the ministry that they are governing remains aligned with the mission of the Catholic Church. As the laity are being increasingly called to undertake governance responsibilities as members or representatives on PJPs, issues of appropriate background and formation for these individuals arise. </p>
							<p>In this paper selected findings from a study of the desired and actual traits of individuals leading PJPs is presented, highlighting areas of strength and weakness in the human, intellectual, spiritual and pastoral dimensions of the role. </p>
