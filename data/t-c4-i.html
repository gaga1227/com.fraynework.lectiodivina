						<h3>A Paradigm Shift from Inward to Outward Focussed Schools</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>In this session, a Catholic Secondary School in Melbourne will discuss their 4 year journey to create a paradigm shift from being an inward to an outward focussed school. Through various highly successful ‘parental engagement’ initiatives linked closely with the National Partnership program the school is now an ACU case study school in this area. </p>
							<p>Caroline Chisholm Catholic College is a multicultural, low SES school with 1500 students located in Braybrook, Melbourne.  The school has worked to implement various initiatives aimed at supporting families to bridge the divide between home and school and to engage parents for learning, through learning and about learning. The school aims to: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Provide parents with tools and skills to access information about the college</li>
								<li>Discuss the ‘language of learning’  in secondary school with parents</li>
								<li>Engage our parents so they feel confident to support student learning in particular in the areas of Literacy and Numeracy in the home setting </li> 
							</ul>
							<p>Programmes implemented for parents and families include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>AMES (Australian Migrant Education Service) English Conversation Classes</li>
								<li>ICT Classes</li>
								<li>Learning at Home Programme</li>
								<li>Lego Robots</li>
								<li>First Aid training for families</li>
								<li>Swimming instruction for families</li>
								<li>Middle years Maths Program</li>
								<li>Maths Tutoring Programme</li>
								<li>VCE Tutoring Program</li>
								<li>Responsible Gaming Choices</li>
