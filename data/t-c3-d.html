						<h3>Leading with Confident Humility in the Midst of Paradox Values in Catholic Education</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The aim of this paper is to present understandings of paradox values and practices of appropriate leadership in the context of contemporary Catholic education in Australia, particularly Catholic schools. ‘Values’ are at the heart of Catholic mission and identity. The proclamation and enactment of Christian values is what draws parents to a Catholic education for their children even though, in increasing numbers, the parents are not committed to the faith tradition out of which the values arise. Paradox values offer challenges and possibilities for school leaders, as was originally discussed by Deal and Petersen in the 1990s in the development of the concept of paradoxical leadership. In Catholic schools paradox values include freedom / belonging, community / plurality, tradition / innovation. Practices for leadership, drawn from literature as well as dialogue with current school leaders, are presented in this paper in order to assist leaders in Catholic schools to identify and engage with paradox values in their community.  Such practices have the potential to contribute to the building of a strong Catholic culture by enhancing the Catholic identity of the community in diversity, and contribute to the carrying out of the mission of the church. </p>

						<h3>The Risk of Education</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The paper aims to present a revitalized Christian proposal to educate children in the faith. In order to educate the young to a Christian life, the main issue is the attractiveness of faith: does faith have a chance to pertain to their needs, desires and real-life impetus? That is the challenge. The paper introduces some possible suggestions, focusing on Giussani’s educative approach. In particular, the suggestions considered come from two of his main works: The Religious Sense (1997) and The risk of education (2001). </p>
							<p>The following suggestions will be proposed and discussed:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>educational processes aim to introduce young people to experience, that is the totality of reality. Faith, as part of this totality, is introduced in young’s life by reality itself and the adult’s educative role is simply to unfold this experience; </li>
								<li>in this process, tradition has a specific role, because it gives to the children an explaining hypothesis to be verified, rather than a fixed explanation about life; </li>
								<li>adults have the responsibility to give to the young the explaining hypothesis, but they need also to give the freedom to refute or transform it and it’s the risk of any education. </li>

						<h3>The Bullying of Staff in Catholic Schools – Both Paradox and Possibility</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Bullying of staff in Catholic schools is a situation of both paradox and possibility. That bullying occurs is beyond contention as almost a decade of research by Riley, Duncan and Edwards amply demonstrates; that it occurs within Catholic schools is a paradox as they are founded on gospel values and are committed to enhancing the dignity of all persons. Bullying of staff diminishes and destroys persons. This paper contends that the bullying of staff occurs in schools which are not actively engaged in asking the question, “Do we have a bully free culture?” Paradoxically, schools not asking this question will end up with a culture of bullying by default as the factors giving rise to bullying are structurally embedded within the school environment.  The solution is found in building a bully free culture, one rich in the values which Catholic schools understand and proclaim; one rich in possibility and complementing the ethos of Catholic schools and Catholic school leadership. Such a culture is encapsulated in the National Framework for a Bully Free Workplace Culture (Riley et al. 2012) </p>
