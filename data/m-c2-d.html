						<h3>Will Catholic Schools Be Catholic In 2030?</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>In the wake of the Public Instruction Act of the 1880’s in which Sir Henry Parkes decreed that all future school education would be ‘free, compulsory, and secular’, the Catholic church decided to ‘go it alone’. This was a courageous decision as it meant the forfeiture of any claim to government funding. And thus it was for the following eighty years! The decision taken, with all the uncertainty and hardships entailed, was grounded in the conviction of the Catholic community that the Catholic school was an integral partner with parents and church in the transmission of faith. </p>
							<p>In the decades to follow, with Catholic schools staffed almost exclusively by Religious and in the context of a strong Catholic culture in parishes, a priority to faith transmission was comparatively easy. </p>
							<p>How can present generations of system and school leaders continue to honour the founding vision in the vastly changed circumstances of society and church in our times? Are Catholic schools at a crossroads or at the frontiers? What new paradigms, policies, and practices are needed to assure that our schools remain Gospel communities within the Catholic tradition? </p>
