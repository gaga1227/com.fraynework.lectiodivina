					<p><strong>Dr Philip Pettit is Senior Officer (Educational Performance and Reporting) at the Catholic Education Office, Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn, Manuka, ACT, Australia. He has a keen interest in leadership and moral agency, particularly involving the use of student achievement data from external testing and classroombased assessment to improve learning outcomes for students. His work chiefly involves promoting datainformed leadership practices at both the school and System level.</strong></p>
					<p>Based on the saying of St Mary MacKillop ‘Never see a need without doing something about it’, his work at the CEO and with ACU centres on the relationship between ‘moral purpose’ and ‘moral action’; in using information on student learning to influence action. A relatively new area in this field is ‘moral potency’, which can be applied to explain the factors that tend to help or hinder the way teachers and school leaders view student achievement data in the first place, and then operationalise its use within the school.				</p>
					<p>Phil obtained his PhD in educational leadership from the Australian Catholic University in 2010. He has had	 papers and articles published in educational leadership journals and has previously presented at the 16th and 17th Annual Values and Leadership Conference (Victoria, Canada and Brisbane, Queensland) and the 5th International Conference on Catholic Educational Leadership (Sydney).			</p>
