							<p>The Catholic Church has been around for almost 2000 years and yet Catholic schools and their leaders are still talking about “identity”. If we, as Catholic educational leaders, are experiencing an identity crisis, it is because we have allowed ourselves to become hamstrung by Government requirements and legal prohibitions and have forgotten the reason that we are in the job in the first place. This presentation argues that while it is necessary to attend with due diligence to our secular duties, we have a greater duty to honour the “whole person” focus of Catholic education. When this focus is truly enacted, the process of leadership comes out of the shadows of empty rules and regulations and, instead, is enlivened by a loving commitment to our own spiritual growth and that of those we seek to lead. Such leadership takes humility, courage, honesty, vision and passion. This presentation dares leaders to engage personally with Jesus and the Gospels, to pick up the innumerable tools of the rich Catholic tradition, to move away from the drawing-board and to start being fully human so as to lead by example, and not by a checklist. </p>
