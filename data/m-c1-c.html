						<h3>An Invitation to the ‘Poor’: Fresh Eyes – New Realities</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Schools need to respond rapidly and effectively to the directions of a changing society in today’s competitive education market. Large-scale decline in active participation within the Catholic Church coupled with increasing representation of families with little, other or no faith commitment in Catholic schools is affecting school cultures. Church leaders and schools are being challenged to consider why Catholic families are not committed users of Catholic education.</p>
							<p>Rising competition for enrolments is absorbing resources and demanding new expertise for leaders. Using a marketing/communication lens to analyse and interpret the stories of participants from low socio economic areas, including refugees and migrants, this paper offers insights with pragmatic tips on how schools can communicate the Catholic offering, especially to potentially marginalised families.</p>
							<p>Factors which influence parents’/carers’ decision-making are presented and suggestions made on the types of messages and methods of communication to reach families. The importance of families’ initial experiences in relating to a school community is highlighted. Strategic responses are offered for schools to rework their activities in early childhood and parish community building to encourage and support families to engage in the enrolment journey.</p>

						<h3>Navigating the Contemporary Policy Terrain: Speaking Back Through Our Identity</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Australian education policy, at national, federal, and state levels, is frequently couched in the language of both excellence (economic) and equity (social). While not mutually exclusive, the simultaneous pursuit of economic advantage is by its very nature rarely socially equitable at scale. This contemporary policy condition creates a wide range of external pressures and internal tensions in the leadership, management and administration of schools. For the contemporary Catholic school the dual masters of economics and equity are an explicit part of our everyday work and location within both the church and the state. </p>
							<p>Although it is easy to demonstrate the negative impact that performative regimes have on leaders, staff and students and to long for the ideal of a socially just utopia, engaging with and not just about policy is difficult. School systems, individual schools and staff are not only embedded, but embody the contemporary policy conditions. This creates an opportunity to speak back to policy and recast our role/s in shaping the conditions in which we work. In this paper I will integrate the theoretical argument with empirical examples of how schools, and individual leaders, have challenged the orthodoxy of ‘quality’ education in contemporary Australia.</p>
