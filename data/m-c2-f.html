						<h3>Looking Within – Reflections on Change</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the influence that a structured school improvement project had on teachers at a primary school in the areas of teaching, learning and leadership for learning. </p>
							<p>This research flowed out of an experience where the school was involved in an improvement project called “Leaders Transforming Learning and Learners”, (LTLL), in collaboration with Australian Catholic University which then led to the development of a structured school improvement project called the “Planning for Authentic Learning Model” (PALM), This model, (PALM), which is the subject of this research, was developed to enable teachers to explore their understanding of teaching, learning and leadership for learning. </p>
							<p>This research is designed to look at the specific impact on teachers involved in a school improvement project as expressed through their own voice. The research question that posed from an interest and research perspective is: How has a structured school improvement project influenced the teaching, learning and leadership for learning? </p>

						<h3>Inclusion for Students with Twice Exceptionality</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Currently there is little research available about who students with twice exceptionality are, their experiences in partnerships with their teachers and the learning environments that nurture their particular talents. ‘Twice exceptional’ is one of the terms used to describe students who are both gifted and have some kind of disability or difficulty. This is a small heterogeneous population of students who exist in special, gifted and mainstream education. They present a unique opportunity for leaders to synthesise best practices across the fields of special, gifted and mainstream education particularly as we transition to more inclusive and collaborative school communities valuing diversity. This paper reviews some of the literature available with implications for pedagogical and school leadership in Catholic Education. </p>

						<h3>Applying the "Integral Model"to Catholic Schools in Mauritius</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The mission of Catholic education in Mauritius is to ‘humanise’ education and pedagogies so that knowledge and skills are more consistent with Catholic values. In January 2004, in the context of reforms in the education system in Mauritius and to be consistent with these values, the Mauritian Catholic Education Bureau (CEB) opted for a new teaching program at the middle level of schooling in Catholic secondary schools. This program which was named ‘mixed ability’ focuses on creative and innovative pedagogies to foster inclusiveness in all catholic secondary schools. </p>
							<p>In a previous study (Dauguet, 2008) I examined a range of factors that supported or impeded the ‘mixed ability’ philosophy at a very early stage of the process of its introduction.</p>
							<p>First, I examined CEB’s attempt to dissociate itself from the numerous issue surrounding the education system in Mauritius, with particular reference to the needs of the 21st century learners and best practice pedagogies, while maintaining a strong social justice focus. </p>
							<p>Second, I developed an ‘Integral Model;’ (Dauguet) that would provide both the theoretical underpinnings and practical means to translate the ‘mixed ability’ philosophy in Catholic secondary schools in Mauritius. The presentation discussed the background to the development of the ‘Integral Model’ and its implementation through the Mauritian Catholic Education Professional Learning Program (CEPLP) which I am leading since 2010 </p>
