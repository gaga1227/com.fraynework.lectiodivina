						<h3 class="c-blk">Catholic Leaders:  'The Fiddlers on the Roof'</h3>
						<p>In a complex and rapidly changing educational and ecclesial environment, Catholic leaders increasingly find themselves 'perched on the roof' of their schools, endeavouring to balance the diversity of demands and expectations being placed on modern learning communities.</p>
						<p>This presentation will explore how contemporary leaders are challenged to strike a balance between their core spiritual and educational values and the practical realities of leading and resourcing a modern school. Just as Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof had to examine his conscience and adjust to a changing social milieu, as each of his daughters sought a partner in marriage, Catholic Leaders are increasingly confronted by a number of paradoxes and emerging possibilities that may cause them to rethink what is "best for their children".</p>
						<p>As education in Australia moves increasingly into a 'Federated Model', the paper will endeavour to identify some key sign posts that may assist the 'lead fiddlers' in every school retain the integrity of their moral purpose whilst adjusting their leadership paradigms to ensure the next generation of Catholic Schools are guaranteed an even brighter future.</p>
