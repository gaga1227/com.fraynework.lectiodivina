						<h3>Australian Catholic Education Systems: Strengths and Challenges for the Future.</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Inspired by the notion that Catholic Education system can be judged on the quality of its graduates, this paper sets out to examine what a Catholic Education system at its best might look like. Drawing upon the literature, the team identified nine themes essential for effective Catholic Education systems and tests these against the ‘wisdom of the elders’. Fifteen current and past Catholic Education Office directors were asked to appraise these themes in terms of their importance to the system and to make a judgement as to the degree to which they are present. They were asked to identify what they consider to be the greatest strength of the system as well as to nominate what they see as priorities into the future. </p>
							<p>In addition to the pressing practical dilemmas of equity, community disengagement and the uncertainty of resources, this leads to a discussion of the purpose of Catholic education, the nature of mission, the role of dialogue and the importance of nurturing the emerging generation of Catholic educational leaders. </p>
