						<h3>A Story of Partnership and School Reform between School and Universities: The Leaders Transforming Learners and Learning Project (2004-2013)</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>This paper will tell the story of The Leaders Transforming Learners and Learning Projects 1, 2 and 3 which have become one of the leading research and community service initiatives in Education in Australia. The LTLL is a project of The Centre for Creative and Authentic Leadership at The Australian Catholic University from 2004 to the present. The LTLL project aims to explore how leadership practices might facilitate the work of school communities in enhancing student learning.  It is an initiative which combines dimensions of professional development, school improvement and research, situated in partnerships between The Centre for Creative and Authentic Leadership at The Australian Catholic University and Catholic Education Offices of nine dioceses throughout New South LTLL III was funded through the National Partnerships Program by the Federal and State Governments. </p>
							<p>In brief, the LTLL model causes school communities to be involved; with support from their districts and Australian Catholic University, in a combination of university- and school-based activities which critically apply a values-based conceptual framework to enhance leadership for learning. </p>
	  						<p>The LTLL Project was designed to meet a stated need within Catholic educational communities for the development of knowledge and practices about leadership for learning that was consistent with the teachings of the Church and relevant to the research and developments in the field of leadership for learning in educational communities. . The LTLL Conceptual model utilised a moral purpose foundation that took its values from the perspectives articulated by the Partner Dioceses in the early stages of the Pilot phase. This resulted in a values -based Conceptual Model that focussed the participating schools on the importance of core values in Catholic education: Catholicity, common good, justice, excellence, and transformation. </p>
							<p>Consistently the research reported a growth in the ownership of the purposes of the School by the community and in the willingness of teachers to volunteer for leadership and learning activities consistent with the aims of the LTLL Project. The LTLL project has received national and international recognition as a leader in the field of school renewal through the use of moral purpose to grow leadership for learning. </p>

						<h3>Partnerships in Catholic School Governance</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The content of my presentation will initially explore a number of questions:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>What do we mean by school governance? </li>
								<li>How does leadership sit within the ministry of governance in Catholic 	education?</li>
								<li>What does a partnership currently look like in practice?</li>
							</ol>
							<p>School governance in Catholic education is currently in the midst of significant change and innovation brought about by the need to explore: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>new ways of ensuring the sustainability of charism and Catholic identity; </li>
								<li>structures that will enable parish priests/canonical administrators to maintain a pastoral role without the burden of organisational governance; </li>
								<li>increasing expectations for accountability and transparency;</li>
								<li>and, connections between schools that will create a stronger and more vibrant Catholic identity, as well as seeking the  opportunity to explore ways of sharing resources and processes to support greater efficiency </li>
							</ul>
							<p>My presentation will share examples and stories of how various individuals, groups and schools have established and nurtured partnerships within the context of Catholic school governance. It aims to share the possible reasons for  a partnership, as well as the processes needed to establish such partnerships. </p>
