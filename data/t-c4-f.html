						<h3>Catholic Pedagogy: A Pedagogy of Hope</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The focus of this paper is clarifying, encouraging and promoting the distinctive nature of Catholic Pedagogy in order to articulate and promote the mission and identity of Catholic schools.  The term Catholic Pedagogy will be used to refer to the distinctive teaching and learning that occurs in Catholic schools to develop a synthesis of culture and faith and a synthesis of faith and life. </p>
							<p>There are five sections to this paper. </p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Section 1:</strong> To develop general notions of authoritative pedagogy and Catholic Pedagogy. </li>
								<li><strong>Section 2:</strong> Draws on the Vatican documents to clarify the moral purpose of Catholic schools and the transformative implications of this for Catholic Schools. </li>
								<li><strong>Section 3:</strong> Presents and discusses three case studies which provide concrete learning experiences consistent with this concept of Catholic pedagogy. </li>
								<li><strong>Section 4:</strong> Summarises the findings from case studies in an attempt to articulate how Catholic pedagogy, as a distinctive pedagogy, exists and transforms schools. </li>
								<li><strong>Section 5:</strong> Concludes with recommendations to develop and embed Catholic pedagogy in classroom practice for Catholic system futures. </li>
