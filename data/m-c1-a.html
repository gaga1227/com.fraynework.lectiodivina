						<h3>A Change of Heart: The Role of Moral Purpose Within a Model of Leading for Learning</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Researchers are advocating for more ethical leadership within school improvement processes (Bezzina 2010; Brown & Trevino, 2006; Duignan, 2006; Shapiro &Gross, 2008; Stefkovich & Begley, 2007) however this is not being operationalized for teachers in schools. At one Catholic primary school teachers who participated in the Australian Catholic University, Leaders Transforming Learning and Learners (LTLL) project developed a model where explicit attention to moral purpose involved teachers focussing on key values and ethics, the moral dimensions of leadership and learning. Authentic learning was unambiguously identified as the moral purpose being pursued in the school and named the ‘Planning for Authentic Learning Model’ (PALM).  The PALM approach included, staff professional learning and planning for authentic learning focussed on the transformed learner and the shared dialogue and practices involving the ethics of authenticity, presence and responsibility (Starratt 2004).</p>
							<p>This paper explores how explicit attention to moral purpose has influenced teacher’s perceptions and practice in teaching, leading and learning. This research adds to the body of knowledge for school leaders in understanding the gap in the research between teachers’ exposure to the moral imperative of education and teachers’ action out of moral purpose to bring about change in schools.</p>

						<h3>Student Leadership in Catholic Schools: A Matter of Service!</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Schools are elementary breeding grounds for student leadership development.   School principals, by virtue of their standing in their school, have a pivotal role in facilitating student leadership development initiatives.  In essence, they are stewards of student leadership (Lavery & Hine, 2012).  This paper examines the notion of student leadership from the standpoint of eight Catholic secondary school principals.  It initially explores their perception of the ethos underpinning student leadership.  On this point, all principals posited that servant leadership must be the overarching model informing student leadership.  The paper then investigates those ways these principals perceived student leadership functioning in their schools.  That is, how was servant leadership explicitly demonstrated in the actions of the students?  Investigating student leadership development is an important issue, both nationally (Bunn et al., 2010) and internationally (Lineburg & Gearheart, 2008; McNae, 2011).  Moreover, the notion of servant leadership as the preferred model of student leadership resonates directly with the Gospel understanding of leadership (Mk 10:42-45; Mt 23:8-12; Lk 22:24-27; Jn 13:12-17). Student leadership formation thus forms part of the fundamental purpose of Catholic education – the evangelisation of young people. </p>

						<h3>Presence: Cultivating a Creative Centre Within Quality Catholic Schools</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The paradox of incessant and competing demands creates unique possibilities for Catholic schools to become places of presence and peace.  Technology rich learning environments, crowded curriculum, high stakes testing and other hallmarks of twenty first century living means that the enduring mission imperative of cultivating an awareness of the presence of God, has both a new urgency and unfolding creative opportunities.  This paper provides a thoughtful synthesis, from a school based reflective practitioner, together with insights drawn from an eclectic range of sources.  The presentation uses a multi layered approach to examine strategies and resources for increasing creativity and deepening presence in Catholic classrooms, staffrooms and in the lives of leaders of educational communities.</p>
