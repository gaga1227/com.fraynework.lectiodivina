						<h3>Leadership for Social Justice and Social Responsibility: From the Possible to the Actual</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>This paper explores the concepts of social justice and social responsibility with regards to Australian Catholic University’s mission to make a specific contribution to its international communities guided by a fundamental concern for social justice. The paper details how the Centre for Creative & Authentic Leadership (CCAL) has addressed this through the hosting of professional development programs for educational leaders from South East Asia and the South Pacific. The case study describes AusAID’s Australian Awards Fellowships (AAF) program hosted by CCAL in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2013. The presentation will review past and the current AAF programs with an emphasis on how these program address CCAL’s endeavours to address social justice. The presentation will include perspectives from current Australian Award Fellows from the  Republic of Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga. Affiliated with the AAF programs is a recently held seminar in Phnom Penh co-hosted by World Education Cambodia and CCAL, and funded by AusAID. This part of the paper will provide a description of the seminar leadership group’s decisions and actions, from the initial conceptualisation through to the seminar’s completion. Some practical examples of how this small group of leaders demonstrated social justice and social responsibility in action are given. The paper concludes by providing some guidelines on how organisations with concerns for social justice and social responsibility can take action in a real and meaningful and way. </p>
