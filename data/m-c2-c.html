						<h3>Dealing with Performance Anxiety:  Tensions for Catholic School Leaders Using Data on Student Achievement Within a Results-driven Culture </h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Schools now have access to an enormous range of data that can be used to improve student learning outcomes.  These data can include classroom-based assessment information as well as results from external testing programs and other sources. Increasingly, though, there is an expectation at system and national policy levels that data on student achievement are collected for public reporting and program accountability.   As such, leaders are being faced with increasing pressure to not only improve student learning, but also to be responsible for producing and influencing publically reported evidence of student achievement. </p>
							<p>These seemingly opposing uses of information highlight a significant paradox for the school leader: the more that data on student learning are used for public reporting to demonstrate the quality of the school, the greater is the temptation to move away from the real learning needs of the individual student. </p>
							<p>This paper examines the implications of this paradox for the Catholic School leader, and presents a possibility.  Examining the relationship between Moral Purpose and Moral Action, the case is made for understanding ‘Moral Potency’ as a key element in influencing the leader’s motivation to act using data on student achievement within a culture of performance and accountability. </p>

						<h3>Deep Learning, ICT and 21st Century Skills</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>One of the key challenges confronting Catholic Education is improving educational quality. A key indicator of improved educational quality is improving student learning outcomes so that students acquire the skills needed for 21st century learning. These skills include creativity, communication, collaboration and critical thinking as well as being productive users of technology. The acquisition of 21st century skills requires the development of personalised learning that is broader than simply an acquisition of the basics. Leaders have a crucial role to play firstly in understanding student learning and in facilitating a teaching and learning program which moves from surface to deep learning. The use of ICT is fundamental for the kind of personalised learning needed for the development of deep learning but, as the SAMR model makes clear, simply using the technology of ICT does not guarantee that the necessary deep learning will occur. What is crucial is the transformative use of ICT for learning. This presentation is designed to link understandings about deep learning with the appropriate use of ICT to enhance learning. </p>

						<h3>Discovering Virtues with Children: a Proposal to Develop Ethical Curriculum in Schools.</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The present paper aims to introduce an ongoing educative research that we’re conducting in order to conceive an ethical curriculum for primary school children. </p>
							<p>Some key elements of our ethical curriculum are the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>it’s grounded in the Ancient Greek Philosophy, with a particular focus on virtues;</li>
								<li>its activities aim to reflect with children on their personal experience, since we consider Ethics to be developed as reflective stance, rather than a list of principles to follow;</li>
								<li>narratives – both listening to and producing - are considered a central tools in order to access children’s experience. We have collected a big amount of data that we have analyzed in order to explore children’s moral thinking and identify which elements fruitfully develop their moral stance. </li>
							</ul>
							<p>The paper describes some research results, which are significant for teachers who want to assume an ethical leadership in working with children. </p>
							<p>Indeed, as Dewey affirms: «the sources of educational science are any portions of ascertained knowledge that enter into the heart, head and hands of educators, and which, by entering in, render the performance of the educational function more enlightened, more humane, more truly educational than it was before» (Dewey, 1929: 76). </p>
