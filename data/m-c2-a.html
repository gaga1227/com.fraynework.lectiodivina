						<h3>Principals’ Experiences of Accountability for Learning in Australia</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>The concerns of Australian educators with regard to the impacts of accountability on learning parallel the concerns of our global peers. Figured in these concerns are a narrow and pseudo-test curriculum and ranking schools according to performance results which in turn impact enrolments. Educational leaders are called upon to make crucial decisions about learning through the growing complexities of the Australian accountability regime. This workshop reports on the investigation of secondary principals in a metropolitian school system in Australia in the ways they view and enact their accountability for learning.</p>
							<p>One preliminary finding in this investigation  indicates that principals do not simply react to accountability requirements, rather they engage in sophisticated sense making processes. Embedded in these sense making processes principals identify accountability for learning  as being a relationship of responsibility and justification . These processes illustrate how leaders engage with this paradox of accountability. This workshop  provides possibilities,  in a practical sense, for those charged with accountability requirements on one hand and at the same time being responsible for learning on the other. These possibilities also may be beneficial for those who support leaders in this pursuit. The workshop aims to engage with the views of  workshop participants with regard to the preliminary findings. </p>

						<h3>Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Based on Ronald Roldheiser’s works “Seeking Spirituality” and “Our One Great Act of Fidelity” with reference to John Maxwell’s “The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership”; and Bill Hybels, “Courageous Leadership”; I will explain how a school leader may manage the tensions between leading a Catholic Community in a largely secular world. School Leaders often live with the possibilities within their local communities and may articulate a clear vision for their school, but then face the paradox of implementing Christ’s vision, their vision, to a largely un-churched, non-religious community of staff, parents and students. The other tension school leaders often face is the interface between their commitment to their own families and their perceived obligations to their workplace. Again the paradox and possibilities may appear at odds, so this presentation will offer strategies in an attempt to do justice to both. Through real life examples of leading Catholic Primary Schools, this presentation is structured to share ideas about practicing the laws of leadership, while being faithful to Christ’s message and faithful to oneself.</p>
