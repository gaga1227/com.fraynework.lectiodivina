						<h3>School and Parish Partnership</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>At a time when enrolments have never been higher, identification with the institutional Church has never been lower, a reality which is equally true of teachers in Catholic schools. This situation seems to pose a challenge to the authenticity of the Catholic school. Doctoral research in three schools identified gaps between parents’ expectations and the schools’ expectations about the purposes of Catholic education, and the structural dissonances between schools and local Churches. The separation or lack of conversation between Catholic school and local parishes identified in the research goes to the heart of the authenticity of the educational mission of the Church itself. The research identified that Catholic schools can neither be substitute parishes nor manage the Church’s educational mission alone. More than this, the question of the authenticity of the Catholic school is also an ecclesiological question. This means that the Catholic school’s strategies and actions can only be seen as part of a larger strategy of the Church itself to educate Catholics. St Monica’s College, a Years 7 – 12 secondary college in Epping, Melbourne and one of its feeder parishes have been working together to bridge this gap. This workshop will explore their journey. </p>
